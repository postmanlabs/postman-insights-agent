# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Postman Insights is designed to let you optimize your API performance in real
time. Using the drop-in Postman Insights Agent, you can bring your API
endpoints into Postman and assess your API traffic. Postman Insights allows you
to create collections based on the endpoints you're interested in the most, so
you can visually inspect your API productivity and fix any errors that may
occur.

Postman is working toward the open launch of Postman Insights. Today, the alpha
release enables you to leverage the Postman Insights Agent on Amazon Elastic
Container Service (ECS) deployments. Within 15 minutes of installing the
Postman Insights Agent in staging or production, you'll start to see endpoints.
The Postman Insights Agent will keep these endpoints up to date based on new
observed traffic and its errors, latency, and volume.

We're excited for you to try out the new features and give us your feedback so
we can continue tailoring the product to your needs.
